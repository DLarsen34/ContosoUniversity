Another Razor Page Tutorial
Parts 1-4
  I really liked doing this tutorial. It was cool to see how pagination worked with this tutorial, It was also good to get 
  more practice with databases. I really enjoyed it.
  
Parts 5-8
  I liked this tutorial as well. It was a little confusing when you get many to many relationships and have to make extra classes
  to be able to make it work. I enjoyed getting a different perspective on Razor and learning a new skill.
